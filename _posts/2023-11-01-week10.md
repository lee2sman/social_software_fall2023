Today:
- making contributions to an open source software project
- working collaboratively on "Chirp"

## Chirp front-end

* coordinate with Landing Page team

Icons 
* coordinate with Accessibility Team

Accessibility and mobile-responsive design 
* coordinate with accessibility team

Special Features Group  (alternative name: Team "Everything else")
* Dark mode and input validation
* if extra time, emotes!

## Install Git

1. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Open your shell (see [shell workflow video](https://youtu.be/FnkkzgYuXUM?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zu_uqEA6NqhLzKLACwU74X)). Configure your git username using the following commands

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

You can find [more details at GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/) as well as [this video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/_sLgRBrZh6o?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zu_uqEA6NqhLzKLACwU74X).

You may be prompted to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Fork Repo

You have two options here. You can fork [Corpora repo directly](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) or the ["Open Source Studio" fork of Corpora](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/corpora). The latter option allows you to experiment with making a pull request that flows through our class before heading "upstream" to Corpora itself. [Instructions for how to fork are on the GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

## Clone the Repo

1. Now you'll want to clone your fork of the repo. Open to your shell, navigate to a directory where you'd like to store the files locally, and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubname/corpora.git
```

[This video has more details about cloning a repo](https://youtu.be/yXT1ElMEkW8?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

2. `cd` (change directory) into the repo.

```
cd corpora
```


## Write your contribution

Now you can open the "corpora" project in any text editor, add a new file, edit files, etc.

### Set nano as your editor for the command line

This only needs to be done once.

```
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

## Commit your changes

Now it's time to "add" and "commit" the work you've done. [This video tutorial has some more details about `git add` and `git commit`](https://youtu.be/9p2d-CuVlgc?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

###  `git add` to stage your changes.

You can choose the files you want to add or just use `.` to add all of your changes.

For a specific file:
```
git add path/to/files/file.json
```

For a specific directory:
```
git add path/to/files/
```

For all files:
```
git add .
```

###  `git commit` to commit your changes.

For small / trivial fixes, you can use the `-m` argument to add a message.

```
git commit -m "message about this commit"
```

It's good practice, however, to use `git commit` only and launch a text editor for writing a more detailed message.

```
git commit
```

You could accidentally open up Vim, a powerful but not-beginner-friendly text editor, if you haven't set your editor in the command line. Type your message here and then to get out of this, press escape, then type :wq   (colon and the letters w and then q) and hit enter.

If you've set nano as your editor, you can save and quit with the commands we've covered previously in week 5. (Ctrol-O saves, Ctrl-X quits).

[Here are details for how to associate text editors with git](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/). For Visual Studio Code the command is:

```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

### Push your code to GitHub.

Now that you've finished your work, you can push the code to your fork of Corpora. One way to do this is:

```
git push origin master
```

While the above is adequate I sometimes prefer to push it to a new branch on GitHub with a name related to my changes.

```
git push origin master:name-of-my-branch
```

This takes the local `master` branch and pushes it to `name-of-my-branch` on GitHub.

## Make a pull request

1. Open your fork on GitHub in your browser.
2. You should see a new button "Compare and Pull Request" referencing your branch name.
3. Select "Compare and Pull Request"
4. Write comments about your changes.
5. Select "Create Pull Request"

### Homework

#### Research and Write

Part 1 and 2 of this homework should be answered in a single blog post on your blog. Please link to your post for homework.

Part 1: Research 

- Listen to [Getting started on open source when you don't know where to start](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/getting-started-on-open-source-when-you-don-t-know-where-to-start) on Code Newbie podcast
- Read [Open Source Doesn't Mean More Software is Better Software](https://www.wired.com/story/more-software-isnt-better-software/)
Write a blog post.

What are some of the advantages to working in open source and list some of the criticisms. As someone potentially new to working in this space, what are your thoughts on open source software, its community and how it's built.


## Research an open source software project and community

Find the web home of open source software you are interested in. Find the web-based locations where it's developed (a GitHub repo, mailing list, forum, etc).

**Address all of the following, and anything else you can say about how the software is made and how you might be able to contribute to it, if possible:**

What is the software? What does it do and who does it serve?

Check out the issues, mailing list, forum, etc. Is there a code of conduct and/or a Contributing document? 

What is the license for the software?

Who created/creates this software? Is it under active development? Who are the maintainers of the software? what is expected of contributors? Write about where in its lifecycle this project: is it a new project or long-developed one (or in between)?

Where is the contribution work done? (GitHub issues, pull requests, mailing list discussions, etc?)

What kind of help do they need? 

What questions do you have (programming languages, test environment, how to set up installation environment)?

If you were going to contribute, what kinds of support or contribution do you think you might be able to help with?
