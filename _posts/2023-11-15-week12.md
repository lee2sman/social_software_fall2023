title: "Week 12: More code contributions + JS on the server"
---

Today:
* warmup: contributing to an open source project (corpora)
* electron, node.js, npm
* check-in's on final project

### Example projects

Darius Kazemi's [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora)

[ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)

[p5.js](http://github.com/processing/p5.js)

- [Tiny Tools Directory](https://tinytools.directory/)


## Install Git

1. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Open your shell (see [shell workflow video](https://youtu.be/FnkkzgYuXUM?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zu_uqEA6NqhLzKLACwU74X)). Configure your git username using the following commands

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

You can find [more details at GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/) as well as [this video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/_sLgRBrZh6o?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zu_uqEA6NqhLzKLACwU74X).

You may be prompted to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Fork Repo

Fork my own copy of [Corpora](https://github.com/lee2sman/corpora). This allows you to experiment with making a pull request that flows through our class before heading "upstream" to Corpora itself. [Instructions for how to fork are on the GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

## Clone the Repo

1. Now you'll want to clone your fork of the repo. Open to your shell, navigate to a directory where you'd like to store the files locally, and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubname/corpora.git
```

[This video has more details about cloning a repo](https://youtu.be/yXT1ElMEkW8?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

2. `cd` (change directory) into the repo.

```
cd corpora
```


## Write your contribution

Now you can open the "corpora" project in any text editor, add a new file, edit files, etc.

### Set nano as your editor for the command line

This only needs to be done once.

```
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

## Commit your changes

Now it's time to "add" and "commit" the work you've done. [This video tutorial has some more details about `git add` and `git commit`](https://youtu.be/9p2d-CuVlgc?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

###  `git add` to stage your changes.

You can choose the files you want to add or just use `.` to add all of your changes.

For a specific file:
```
git add path/to/files/file.json
```

For a specific directory:
```
git add path/to/files/
```

For all files:
```
git add .
```

###  `git commit` to commit your changes.

For small / trivial fixes, you can use the `-m` argument to add a message.

```
git commit -m "message about this commit"
```

It's good practice, however, to use `git commit` only and launch a text editor for writing a more detailed message.

```
git commit
```

You could accidentally open up Vim, a powerful but not-beginner-friendly text editor, if you haven't set your editor in the command line. Type your message here and then to get out of this, press escape, then type :wq   (colon and the letters w and then q) and hit enter.

If you've set nano as your editor, you can save and quit with the commands we've covered previously in week 5. (Ctrol-O saves, Ctrl-X quits).

[Here are details for how to associate text editors with git](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/). For Visual Studio Code the command is:

```
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

### Push your code to GitHub.

Now that you've finished your work, you can push the code to your fork of Corpora. One way to do this is:

```
git push origin master
```

While the above is adequate I sometimes prefer to push it to a new branch on GitHub with a name related to my changes.

```
git push origin master:name-of-my-branch
```

This takes the local `master` branch and pushes it to `name-of-my-branch` on GitHub.

## Make a pull request

1. Open your fork on GitHub in your browser.
2. You should see a new button "Compare and Pull Request" referencing your branch name.
3. Select "Compare and Pull Request"
4. Write comments about your changes.
5. Select "Create Pull Request"


# Homework

## Open Source Data Assignment

- *[Forked and adapted from Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Syllabus/blob/source/data-assignment.md)*

Based on the work you've done in in class today, submit your own contribution to Corpora.

**Attention, if you choose number 1 below, please submit this to Lee's fork! Then we can later merge with the main.**

### Pick one of the below (just one! not all!)

1. Contribute to Corpora (see instructions below).
2. Create your own open source dataset in a new repository on GitHub.
3. Make a contribution to another Open Source repository focused on data.

### Electron

What is Electron?

> Electron is a free and open-source software framework developed and maintained by GitHub.It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies: it combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. Electron is the main GUI framework behind several open-source projects including Atom, GitHub Desktop, Light Table, Visual Studio Code, Evernote, and WordPress Desktop.

Also: Discord, Slack, Whatsapp, Beaker Browser, Skype, Signal, Visual Studio Code, Etcher, Ramme (instagram on the desktop),  and many others.

How does it work?

In short: it packages a website as an application, a full browser itself along with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js for a specific app. 

Advantages:
- "write once, work everywhere"
- use a language you already know
- lots of learning / building resources and a community of people working with it

Disadvantages:
- Not native-specific design
- "Bloated" (packages an entire Chrome-based web browser, which may be redundant)
- Security

Electron-Fiddle makes working with Electron easier.

[Download](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) Electron-Fiddle

Electron-Fiddle speeds up the build process even faster, with little usable snippets. Its essential components are Node.js, Chromium (Open source implementation of Google Chrome), and Electron.

### Electron Applications

1. Main process (main.js)
2. HTML page (index.html)
3. Preload script
4. Renderer process (renderer.js)

You can save fiddle projects as a github gist (a single page of code) or output a binary executable application file.

#### Basics of Electron

Every Electron app starts with a main process, usually ```main.js```

To display a GUI user interface the main process creates renderer processes â€“ usually windows, which Electron calls ```BrowserWindow```.

The default fiddle creates a new BrowserWindow and loads an HTML file, index.html

The index.html requires (pulls in) our renderer.js file using a ```<script></script>``` tag.

The renderer.js file contains node.js code. You can also require (pull in) additional NPM packages here and Fiddle will automatically install them. 

### Alternative browsers

Text browsers:
I have installed these on anti-soft

- w3m
- links
- lynx

Graphical browsers

Beyond Chrome, Firefox and Safari, there are many other browsers, including: 

[Falkon](https://www.falkon.org/)

[Opera](https://www.opera.com/)

[Brave](https://brave.com/)

[Dillo](https://www.dillo.org/)
