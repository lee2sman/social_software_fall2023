HTML Comments / notes for yourself

## Starter code from class:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My plain website
    </title>
    <style>
    
      </style>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="the">
      
     <h1>
      Important info!
    </h1>
    <h2>
      slightly less important but still freaking important!
    </h2>
    <h3>
      somewhat important?
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I am a <em><strong>para</strong>strong graph</em> of important info. 
     I am part 
          of
                    the sa
      me block.
    </p>
    <hr>
       <div class="lowerhalf">
    <p>

    </p>
    <br>

   <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/4123bb0d-5d94-499b-9b6f-c2f290ed0780/Nc_GFr.png?v=1693430096953">
    
        </div>

  </body>
  
</html>
```

### CSS

CSS is for your style. Things like colors, placement, font choices, font sizes, etc. We added the following CSS code inside the <style></style> part of the head.

```
    body {
        width: 50%;
        margin-left: 25%;
        background-color: #caf0f8;
        color: blue;
      }
      hr {
        border-color: #03045e;
      }
      img {
        width: 500px;
      }
      .lowerhalf {
        background-color: #90e0ef;
      }
      .the {
        background-color: #0077b6;
      }

```

## Exercise: A "now page"

Create a *now* page.

At a minimum the page should have some info about you, a name or nickname, what you are currently studying and/or what you are currently reading or watching.

Include at least one image.

The page can be as minimal or complex as you like, but it should be good.

Examples:

[nownownow](https://nownownow.com/).

* [xxiivv](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html)
* [Lee Tusman](https://leetusman.com/now/)
* [Serena Chen](https://serena.nz/now/)
* [Helen Baal](https://www.helenvanbaal.com/now/)


Afterwards...

Visit the [Low Tech Webring Directory](https://emreed.net/LowTech_Directory.html).

## Homework

Visit [Gossip's Web](https://gossipsweb.net/).

Exercise 1:

Explore Gossip's Web and visit some of the links. Take your time, don't rush. What is the purpose? Who does it serve? What kinds of pages exist (site architecture)? How does the architecture and design serve the goal of the site? What are your overall impressions?

Exercise 2:

Finish your now/ page (see above activity) and upload to the internet (link to it on Moodle) or upload to Moodle.

This site should be informational and aesthetically compelling!
