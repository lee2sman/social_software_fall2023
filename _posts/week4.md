### Add ourselves to the webring

Please add the onionring code to your now page that you previously uploaded. It's probably best to place this before the closing ```</body>``` tag.

Do you have a good workflow? Set up a system for yourself to easily upload updated pages to your server space.

The code to embed for our webring is here. Add to your now page or whatever page you want people to be brought to via the webring. Note: I set this previously based on what page you linked to from Moodle for homework.

```
	  <!-- START Anti-Software Social Club Ring embed code -->
		<div id="social">
			<script
				type="text/javascript"
				src="/lee.tusman/assets/js/onionring-variables.js"
			></script>
			<script
				type="text/javascript"
				src="/lee.tusman/assets/js/onionring-widget.js"
			></script>
		</div>
	  <!-- END Anti-Software Social Club Ring embed code -->
```
