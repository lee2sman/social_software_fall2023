<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>

<p>The Purchase College academic integrity policy explicitly forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or imitation of the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another person and the representation of them as one’s own original work. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods of attribution. Violation of any of the above may lead to formal disciplinary action and the following sanctions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimum Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or examination. Maximum Sanction: Expulsion</li>
  <li>Recommended Sanction (First Offense): Failing grade for the course</li>
  <li>Recommended Sanction (Second Offense): Expulsion</li>
</ul>

<p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether any activity is academically permissible should check with the instructor.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-statement">Accessibility Statement</h3>

<p>The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability Resources as soon as possible, 914-251-6035, ODR@purchase.edu (Student Services Building, #316A), https://www.purchase.edu/odr.</p>

<h3 id="mental-health-and-well-being">Mental Health and Well-being</h3>

<p>University faculty and staff recognize that mental health and stress can impact college performance and interfere with daily life activities. At Purchase, Counseling &amp; Behavioral Health Services can provide support if you’re struggling with feeling overwhelmed, anxious, depressed, lost, stuck or in a crisis. Please call (914)251-6390 or visit the <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-center/">Counseling Center website</a>  for more information. CBHS services are free and confidential.</p>

<p>We support all students experiencing emergencies. Services include therapy, support groups, stress reduction at the Harbor Center, and other activities.  The Counseling Center in Humanities Lower Level is open M-F, from 9:00a.m.– 5:00p.m. for appointments and walk-up scheduling, or call (914) 251-6390.  The Harbor Center Sanctuary in Fort Awesome is available for stress reduction, mindfulness and meditation training, free drop-in classes and support groups, and relaxation.</p>

<h3 id="student-contact">Student Contact</h3>

<p>All students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with Purchase College’s Student Code of Conduct.  Any repetitive or disruptive behavior, including but not limited to outbursts, intoxication/drug use, personal or physical threats, damage to property, etc., may result in the professor requesting the student to leave class, contacting University Police, and/or notifying the Office of Community Standards.</p>

<h3 id="learning-center-tutoring-support">Learning Center (Tutoring Support)</h3>

<p>All students at Purchase College can take advantage of our tutoring services in the Learning Center and the Einstein Corner. These are free, 45-minute, peer-to-peer tutoring sessions in a variety of subjects and in writing across the disciplines. Sessions can happen in person or through the Online Writing Lab up to 3x/week. The OWL allows students to submit a paper draft and get written feedback by email within 48 business hours. We strongly recommend face-to-face meetings for first-year students and multilingual writers. I encourage you to take advantage of this service to help you excel in this class, as well as your other courses. Please visit the Learning Center and Einstein Corner websites for more information.</p>

<h3 id="classroomstudio-expectations">Classroom/Studio expectations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Please be on time, listen actively, and participate in class discussion and activities.</li>
  <li>Please put cell phones in ‘sleep’ mode at the start of class. If you need such devices for personal obligations, please take a break and leave the classroom.</li>
  <li>Laptops may be used in class for note taking and coding only. During class, don’t check social media, do homework for other classes, buy things, etc. Stay engaged in the class!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Attendance and punctuality are expected for every class.</li>
  <li>Attendance will be taken at every class.</li>
  <li>Your presence is vital for participation in varied learning activities and small-group work.</li>
  <li>You are allowed 1 unexcused absences.</li>
  <li>Additional unexcused absences may affect your grade.</li>
  <li>Late arrivals or early departures may be counted as absences.</li>
  <li><strong>If you are sick, don’t come to class. Get in touch with the professor.</strong></li>
  <li>If you miss class, it is your responsibility to find out from classmates what you missed and submit assignments on time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. Each class builds on what you have learned in previous classes. Missing class can substantially set you back in this process. Therefore, it is important that you attend every class.</p>

<h3 id="homework-and-projects">Homework and Projects</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Submit your work on time for full credit</li>
  <li>To receive an extension, consult with the instructor</li>
  <li>All work needs to be accompanied by a file with title, Description, Link, and Screenshots. There may be other requirements as well.</li>
  <li>Smaller homework projects lead up to completion of larger projects</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an upper level course and students are expected to be extremely self-directed. This is a 4 credit class with 12 hours of outside class work per week.</p>

<p>This class REQUIRES collaboration!</p>

<p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material is part of the learning process. Students are allowed to collaborate to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in order to simply find out a solution to a project. Each participant should contribute approximately equally, and what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from another student, even if you change a few minor things such as variable names, is not a collaboration. You may help someone learn something, but you can not tell them what to code. If you have questions about collaboration or academic integrity, get in touch with me via email, talk with me before or after class, or come to office hours.</p>

<h3 id="no-quizzes-no-exams">No Quizzes, No Exams</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There are no quizzes or exams in this course</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="university-and-classroom-policies-and-rules">University and Classroom Policies and Rules</h1>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Plagiarism and cheating are taken seriously. You will be held accountable for Purchase’s <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/student-code-of-conduct/section-a-academic-integrity/index.php">Student Code of Conduct for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tentative-nature-of-syllabus">Tentative Nature of syllabus</h2>

<p>If needed, this syllabus and the course outline may be revised to better suit the class. Students are responbile for keeping up with any changes distributed via email or in class. The most up to date syllabus will always be up to date on the class site.</p>

<h3 id="lees-values">Lee’s values</h3>

<p>We are all learners and educators. I’m looking forward to learning from you as much as I hope to share my own knowledge. Your experience and participation is valid and necessary. I am not the sole source of information. You are responsible for and encouraged to be in charge of your own education. Leap forth into areas of interest. Teach with and learn from others.</p>

<p>Please hold me accountable and point out areas that need to be improved.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help each other out. Ask lots of questions of me and your fellow students.</li>
  <li>Learning to program is failure followed by success.</li>
  <li>If you are feeling left behind, stuck, or frustrated in any way, please let me know immediately. I am here to help.</li>
  <li>Sleep enough hours. Good sleep will get you through college, reduce stress, help you do well in class, and feel better.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expectations-of-professor">Expectations of Professor</h2>

<p>I will be accessible to you in class, office hours, and online. I will respond promptly within 24 hours during the schoolweek to any questions and can clarify anything from our class.</p>

<p>I will use your preferred name and pronouns and treat you with respect.</p>

<p>If you come to me with a request or feedback I will listen and give my full consideration.</p>

<p>If you have a concern or an emergency I will help you to services and support.</p>

<p>I will give prompt and clear feedback to you on your progress in class at set points in the semester and any time you make a request via email.</p>

<h3 id="free-libre-and-open-source-software">Free, Libre and Open Source Software</h3>

<p>A large part of this course will use and build upon free, libre and open source software (sometimes abbreviated as FLOSS). We will talk about FLOSS software, why one may want to use and contribute to it, and its impact on technology and society today.</p>

<h3 id="requesting-help">Requesting Help</h3>

<p>We will be using Discord for a class server. It is the fastest way to get answers to questions. If you already use Discord you may already have a nickname. You can right click your name in chat and select an alternate name different from your other servers.</p>

<p><strong>Please note: Since this is a course dedicated to Social Software, all code questions should be asked publicly. Please use the #questions channel rather than message the instructor directly. Please place all code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> tags.</strong></p>

<p>When asking questions it is helpful for you to post a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal version</a> along with what you expected and what you are getting. For non-code questions you can email me directly or speak to me in class or at office hours. It can take me up to 24 hours to respond to emails, and longer on weekends or at the end of semesters.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Work with your classmates inside and outside of class</li>
  <li>Do Pair Programming</li>
  <li>Start your homework early, do it in a quiet place, and minimize distractions. Expect 8 hours of work outside class per week.</li>
  <li>Stay on top of your work. It will be hard to recover if you fall behind.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grades">Grades</h3>

<ul>
  <li>60% Three assignments. (20% each)</li>
  <li>20% Class participation; attendance and readiness; homework</li>
